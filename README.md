# Nakehko_net
Dene-built satcom. Survives everything. One price. Own it forever.

- Why? KISS principle in action—turns "read me" into "run me." Lowers the bar for that first fork, nods to Exodus (the loop in the net), and makes the README a gateway, not a wall. (Fits in 100 chars.)

Updated full README with these baked in (copy-paste ready—commit as "Fires forked"):

# NakehkoNet

**Two Fires. One Sky. Dene-Built. World-Free.**

*NaKehko: "Two Fires" in Dene—warmth for the hearth, signal for the stars. One keeps the cold out. One calls the world in.*

Started as a riff on Starlink's gaps. Ended as sovereignty in code. No subscriptions. No silence. Buy once, own the signal forever. For elders calling home in -50°C. For drones that don't jam. For the North that bends, never breaks.

## The Fixes (25 Ways We Beat the Storm)
- **Fire #1 (Warmth):** Survives -50°C hurricanes. No latency. No excuses.
- Encrypts any signal—Starlink, Telesat, yours. Quantum-proof. No leaks.
- One-time fee. Buy once. No monthly ransom.
- Pi-powered. $35 nodes on rez rooftops. No towers, no permits.
- Open-source. Fork it. Harden it. Make it yours.
- Names etched in firmware. Not ads. Legacy.
- Dene-owned. Revenue reinvested. North-first.
- Bends to weather, culture, code. Be like water.
- No cutoffs. Elders don't beg. Signals don't expire.
- **Fire #2 (Signal):** Mesh for drones, rigs, ham radio.
- Freedom in the wires. No centralized cage.
- Self-healing loops. If one node freezes, the fire spreads.
- Dene roots. Two fires: one warms, one lights the way.
- Global lungs, northern heart. All humans, one sky.
- No ego. No Elon. Just dignity in the ping.
- Ethical by design. No extraction. Just exchange.
- 13¢ start. Infinite end. From parking lot to polar orbit.
- Play, not force. Riff like Mozart. Flow like water.
- Ontology in the onion. Am I secure? Yes. We make it so.
- Bamboo, not oak. Snaps back from the gale.
- Cultural code. Encrypt in Dene dialects. Land speaks.
- No debt. No dark. Pi's cheap. Sky's free.
- Avalanche from one flake. Fork us. Start your fire.
- Two fires burn brighter. NaKehko: warmth + signal.
- We make it so. Not please. Not maybe. Now.
